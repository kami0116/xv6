In this assignment you will add a system call tracing feature that may help you when debugging later labs. You'll create a new trace system call that will control tracing. It should take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which system calls to trace. For example, to trace the fork system call, a program calls trace(1 << SYS_fork), where SYS_fork is a syscall number from kernel/syscall.h. You have to modify the xv6 kernel to print out a line when each system call is about to return, if the system call's number is set in the mask. The line should contain the process id, the name of the system call and the return value; you don't need to print the system call arguments. The trace system call should enable tracing for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks, but should not affect other processes.
