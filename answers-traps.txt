1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
没有call方法f，直接在编译阶段给他算出来了，结果是12。然后给a1赋值为12

3. At what address is the function printf located?
0x64a

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x3a，就是jalr的指令地址

5. The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
HE110 World， 如果是大端模式，i=0x726c6400

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
不确定，取决于a2的值
